## Today's workshop

Demonstrate the following in `R`:

- read in and manipulate tabular data
- do some basic statistics
- do some graphing

I'm assuming you're brand new to `R`. The emphasis today is on working with data, not programming with `R`.
\ 

The goal: get you started and comfortable enough to help yourself go further with `R`.

## A little about `R`

- A statistical computing environment with its own language
- Released in 2000; an open source implementation of S
- Highly regarded for its graphical facilities
- Maintained by volunteers
- https://www.r-project.org/


## RStudio

- I recommend you use `R` with the free RStudio IDE (Interactive Development Environment).

- RStudio makes it easier to learn and use `R`.

- It does things like autocomplete, syntax highlighting, and much more.

- **After you install `R` and RStudio, you only need to run RStudio.**



## `R` basics - functions

* `R` uses *functions* to do things.

* Functions take *arguments* to specify how, or to what, to do those things. Example:

    + `read.csv(file="scores.csv")` 

* `read.csv` is a function to import a CSV file; `file` is an argument that specifies which file to import.




## `R` basics - running functions

Two common ways to run functions:

1. From the command line; type the function and hit Enter
2. In an `R` script; type one or more functions, and run one or more of them by highlighting and hitting Ctrl + Enter (Win) or Command + Enter (Mac)

An `R` script is a text file that contains all your `R` code. `R` scripts allow you to save, edit, reproduce and share your code.   
\ 

Today's workshop will be centered around an `R` script I wrote in advance.



## `R` basics - assignment

* We often need to save a function's result or output. For this we use the assignment operator: ` <- `  

* For example, when you import a CSV file you need to give it a name: 

`scores <- read.csv(file="scores.csv")`   
 
* Now we can use `scores` as an argument to other functions. For example, compute summary statistics for each column in the data:

`summary(scores)` 

* **Note**: Use `Alt + -` (Win) or `Option + -` (Mac) in RStudio to quickly insert ` <- `. You can also use `=` for assignment.


## `R` basics - packages

- All functions belong to *packages*. The `read.csv` function is in the `utils` package.

- `R` comes with about 30 packages (called "base `R`"), but as of January 2017 there are close to 10,000 user-contributed packages! 

- Example: `ggplot2` is a popular package that adds functions for creating graphs in a different way than what base `R` provides

- To use functions in a package, the package must be installed and loaded. (They're free)

- You only _install_ a package once. 

- You _load_ a package whenever you want to use its functions. 

## Let's get sta`R`ted!

- Open RStudio and follow along with me!

- First we'll work at the command line.

- Then we'll open the R script I prepared for this workshop (`Intro_R_workshop.R`).

- Don't hesitate to ask questions!
